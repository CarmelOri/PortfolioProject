Portfolio Project


Overview

This is my personal portfolio project showcasing my skills and projects.
The portfolio includes a gallery with 7 sample landing pages that I created using HTML, CSS, SASS, and Bootstrap.


Technologies Used

HTML: For the structure and content of the web pages.

CSS: For styling and layout.

SASS: For more efficient and modular CSS.

Bootstrap: For responsive design and pre-built components.


Features

Responsive Design: Ensures that the portfolio looks good on all devices, development practices.

Gallery: A collection of 7 unique landing pages, each demonstrating different design styles and functionalities.


The main portfolio:
-At the top of the page there is a responsive navigation bar, in which you can go to every section of the page. When in smaller media queries, the menu is folded into an "hamburger" which upon clicking opening the menu.
-A welcoming area with a short explanation about the page.
-A section with the logos of the technologies used in the project.
-Below that there is an about me section with a short summary about me and a photo, and also a link to view or download my CV. styled it with the "grid" function.
-Projects section: a grid containing all of my projects, when each project is clicked it transfers you into its index page, where you can view or download the project.
-Contact me section, a form where the visitor can leave his information if he wants to reach me. At the moment this section is only cosmetic, in a few months it will be connected to a database (hopefully).
-Clickable icons, upon clicking the user is transferred into the relevant page, or into a premade email field with my email address already filled in.
-a bottom section with credits for building the page.



Gallery

The gallery contains the following landing pages:

Landing page 1: Coffee: a big photo on the right, and a form with 2 fields to the left. When the screen is folded, the photo moves to the top of the page. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive.

Landing page 2: Take you forward: a big headline at the top of the page, and a horizontal form with 2 input fields below it. There is also a background picture. When the page is folded, the form becomes vertical. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive.

Landing page 3: Here and now: a big headline with a font that is viable via link to google fonts. A horizontal form with 2 input fields below it. There is also a background with a mixed color. When the page is folded, the form becomes vertical. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive.

Landing page 4: Free Consultation: in this one I had to do it in English because the rtl function messed up my styling and I couldn't figure it out on time. The page contains a top and bottom yellow bars with different lengths, 6 images, and a form with 3 input fields. When folded, one picture disappears (display: none;) and one becomes smaller. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive.

Landing page 5: Take you forward (pink): contains a background for half of the page, a section in the middle of the page with a headline, paragraph and a form with 2 fields. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive.

Landing page 6: Discover the world: A gallery of 14 different photos, placed in a grid. There is also a 2x2 text section, and a 2x3 form section with 3 fields. When filed, the grid changes from 4x6 to a 2x12 grid. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive.

Landing page 7 (bonus project): in this project I wanted to create a page where I can showcase some videos of me playing, from shows, collaborations with friends or just some random bass covers I upload occasionally. I used html to build the foundation of the page, css to style it and bootstrap to make it responsive. I also used some JavaScript to take the iframe videos and put them in a functional slideshow. (Though i still need to figure out how to automatically
 "kill" the audio of one video when another one starts to play)

Personal notes:
The project is missing a lot of SASS functionality-i have made a mistake and started my big projects without it, and later when I finished I couldn't manage to merge the SASS with an existing code, every solution I have tried just made my pages unfunctional. Hope that you'll still enjoy!

In the rest of the topics (html css and bootstrap) there was definitely a learning curve but now I can say that I'm  a lot better at those topics after I worked on this project.

Hope you enjoy!
